# Cat and Dog Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network #  
A simple experiment for classifying cat and dog image using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This experiment aims for me to learn CNN for image classification. Models are built with TensorFlow and Keras. Training done in Gradient Paperspace with jupyter notebook and free GPU Nvidia M4000. Using pretrained models can achieve accuracy up to 98%, while custom cnn model can achieve accuracy up to 91%.

## Dataset ##  
Dataset used in this experiment is from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data 

## CNN Architecture ##
I am using 4 CNN architecture to play with. 1 architecture is a custom CNN architecture and 3 others are using pretrained models :
1. Custom CNN
2. VGG16
3. MobileNetV2
4. ResNet50
